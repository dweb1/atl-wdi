				<p>Hes not a war hero. Hes a war hero because he was captured. I like people that werent captured, OK, I hate to tell you. One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people donâ€™t go into government.A certificate of live birth is not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination as a birth certificate.The wall will go up and Mexico will start behaving.The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our leaders can't say no!</p>
